# Extracts information from Emacs Lisp libraries

This package extends the built-in `lisp-mnt`, which is only
suitable for libraries that closely follow the header conventions.
Unfortunately there are many libraries that do not - this library
tries to cope with that.

It also defines some new extractors not available in `lisp-mnt`,
and some generalizations of extractors available in the latter.
